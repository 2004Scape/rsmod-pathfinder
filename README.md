# rsmod-pathfinder

A breadth-first search pathfinder.
(The fastest in all the land)

Ported from Kotlin: https://github.com/rsmod/rsmod/tree/main/engine/pathfinder

## Installing (Consuming)

https://www.npmjs.com/package/@2004scape/rsmod-pathfinder

```shell
npm i @2004scape/rsmod-pathfinder
```

----

## Command Notes

```shell
wasm-pack build --target nodejs --out-dir dist --out-name rsmod-pathfinder # Builds the wasm bundle.
~/IdeaProjects/wabt/bin/wasm2wat  dist/rsmod-pathfinder_bg.wasm -o src/rsmod.wat # Generates the wat file.
npm publish --access public # Publishes the version of this to npm.
```

## Benchmarks

I have created `main.js` and `main.rs` for synthetic examples of performance.
They load in a full reconstruction of the Lumbridge mapsquare (64x64) tiles
with full clipping flags set. Then in a loop it runs through 100k pathfinder
requests to a destination +10 tiles North with a single access point to the destination.
